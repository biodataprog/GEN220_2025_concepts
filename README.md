# GEN220_2025_concepts
Revamped Concept Teaching for GEN220

## Data focused with UNIX and Python

1. Column data focused extraction and analysis (CSV, TSV, BED, GFF)
  * csv processing with csvkit and cut
  * cut, sort, uniq, wc to counting lines that match, getting aggregate numbers
3. Coordinate analysis, overlap
   * BEDtools
   * SNPs overlapping genes, what are the genes with most SNPs?
   * How many bases / % of genome are repeats? How many for each class of repeats?
4. Comparative content
   * Orthology, Gene family presence/absence/copy number patterns
   * Venn/Upset plots
