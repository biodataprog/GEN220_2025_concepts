# GEN220_2025_concepts
Revamped Concept Teaching for GEN220

## Data focused with UNIX, Python, and R

1. Column data focused extraction and analysis (CSV, TSV, BED, GFF)
  * csv processing with csvkit and cut
  * cut, sort, uniq, wc to counting lines that match, getting aggregate numbers
3. Coordinate analysis, overlap
   * BEDtools
   * SNPs overlapping genes, what are the genes with most SNPs?
   * How many bases / % of genome are repeats? How many for each class of repeats?
4. Comparative content
   * Orthology, Gene family presence/absence/copy number patterns
   * Venn/Upset plots

## Data munging

1. Converting file formats
   * Sequence data examples
3. Writing simple python processing
   * Bulk renaming or reformatting data

## Genomics and Evolutionary focused data

1. Sequence data types
2. Genome assembly
3. Population data
    * Variant calling into VCF format
    * VCF querying, reprocessing with bcftools
    * vcfR to visualize and QC
    * PCA and Trees from VCF
    * Structure plots
5. Phylogenetic tree construction and aggregation
6.
